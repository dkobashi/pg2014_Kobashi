1.  Write a function to return a list of N Fibonacci numbers.
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number

>>> fib(1)
[1, ]

>>> fib(2)
[1, 1]

>>> fib(6)
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]




2.  Write a function to compute the integral of a list of numbers [f_n(x_n)] using the trapezoidal rule with a default value of dx=1.0
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule

>>> f = [1.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
>>> integrate(f)
10.0

>>> integrate(f, dx=0.5)
5.0


3.  Write a function to read the data from the file discharge.dat, return a list of dates (as datetime objects) and discharge (ignoring any flags).


ADVANCED QUESTIONS:

4.  Write a function to read data from the file drifter.dat.  Return a dictionary based on the track name as indices, returning a list of lat/lon pairs:

EG.  

Track	FRODO		00:00:00	776 ft	0 mph	

starts the segment of the data for track 'FRODO'.  Then, the data are stored as:

>>> tracks = read_drifter('drifter.dat')
>>> tracks['FRODO']
[(43.3232, 121.3132), 
...
(43.1313, 121.4546)]
